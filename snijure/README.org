won't do

tried, but the aspects were not working anymore, so rollbacked to no
packages

do we really need it ? I don't think so as the target will probably
specified explicitly (ie com.my.company.*), instead of allowing everything
but a few restricted packages (ie don't weave java.*)

*** DONE [improvement] we dont need another class to inject the callback, because the code for the aspect will be compiled as a class so we just need to provide a setter

** TODO add a way to inject the callback to the agent
** TODO solve the "aop will intercept anything" problem [%]
** TODO fail fast if the prop =snijure.pgks= has not been given
* TODO nice to have [%]
** TODO check the license of aspectJ to know if we can embed it

it would allow to embed the aspectj libs, to avoid the user having to
install them
* TODO ideas [%]

** TODO allow to alter args / return values / exceptions (or even don't throw the exception)

It would be straightforward to change the signature of the Callback, and
the agent code to allow:
- Changing the parameters passed to the intercepted method: Just make
  =before= returns an array of params
- Changing the return value of the intercepted method: just make =after=
  returns a (possibly) modified return value
- Changing the exception, or even changing it to no exception and return
  value instead: just change =afterThrow= to returns an (possibly
  modified) exception (and maybe an additionnal flag to indicate that we
  want to change the exception by a normal return value)
