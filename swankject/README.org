won't do

tried, but the aspects were not working anymore, so rollbacked to no
packages

do we really need it ? I don't think so as the target will probably
specified explicitly (ie com.my.company.*), instead of allowing everything
but a few restricted packages (ie don't weave java.*)

won't do, it will be done by configuring the =aop.xml=

Can't do.

It was a wrong lead, as I don't know how to get pkg to weave after
compiling the aspect.

To do that we should use =aop.xml=, which allow to specify in an xml
file what to intercept (classes, method calls, ...)

* TODO nice to have [0%]
** TODO check the license of aspectJ to know if we can embed it

it would allow to embed the aspectj libs, to avoid the user having to
install them
** TODO before/after/afterThrow => around

because we use before/after/afterThrow instead of around
we can read but not modify
it would be nice to be able to modify the args of a method, the return
value, the execption, ...


* TODO ideas [%]

** TODO allow to alter args / return values / exceptions (or even don't throw the exception)

It would be straightforward to change the signature of the Callback, and
the agent code to allow:
- Changing the parameters passed to the intercepted method: Just make
  =before= returns an array of params
- Changing the return value of the intercepted method: just make =after=
  returns a (possibly) modified return value
- Changing the exception, or even changing it to no exception and return
  value instead: just change =afterThrow= to returns an (possibly
  modified) exception (and maybe an additionnal flag to indicate that we
  want to change the exception by a normal return value)
