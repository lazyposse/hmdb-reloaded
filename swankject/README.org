won't do

tried, but the aspects were not working anymore, so rollbacked to no
packages

do we really need it ? I don't think so as the target will probably
specified explicitly (ie com.my.company.*), instead of allowing everything
but a few restricted packages (ie don't weave java.*)

won't do, it will be done by configuring the =aop.xml=

***** CANCELLED code the agent so that we weave only the given package(s) [100%]
CLOSED: [2012-08-18 Sat 02:48]

Can't do.

It was a wrong lead, as I don't know how to get pkg to weave after
compiling the aspect.

To do that we should use =aop.xml=, which allow to specify in an xml
file what to intercept (classes, method calls, ...)

CLOSED: [2012-08-22 Wed 12:26]

Not relevant anymore

*** DONE agent must wait for clojure signal to continue
CLOSED: [2012-09-11 Tue 13:15]

This will allow the user to have time to do the necessary setup before
the app to start



** IN-PROGRESS implement a callback that capture all the method calls [50%]

it behaves well

***** DONE how clojure.xml behaves with XStream's XML ?
CLOSED: [2012-09-08 Sat 13:49]

it behave badly (adds linebreak)

***** DONE how clojure.data.xml behaves with XStream's XML ?
CLOSED: [2012-09-08 Sat 13:49]

it behave well (year!)

**** TODO need to serialize args and return values

*** IN-PROGRESS capture meth calls with a BigProject [33%]

**** DONE add more logs to understand why it's not working
CLOSED: [2012-09-11 Tue 17:12]

Well it is working :)

It's just that the javaagent is not even loaded if there's no pointcuts
to match.
For example: the aop.xml come with the pointcut sample..*.
If you try to run it on your project com.mycompany it won't do anything
You have to change the aop.xml to com.mycompany..*

**** TODO properly format the java code
**** CANCELLED rename callback => snijureCallback
CLOSED: [2012-08-22 Wed 12:26]

Not really needed

**** DONE rename the project swankject
CLOSED: [2012-08-22 Wed 12:26]

That's because I ve got the warning by leiningen that clojure projects
finishing by 'jure' aren't welcome :)


*** DONE add more tools in the repl (doc, javadoc, ...)
CLOSED: [2012-08-22 Wed 12:33]


*** TODO rename the project (again!) as swank will be replaced by nrepl


*** DONE separate the capture logic code from the agent interaction code
CLOSED: [2012-09-14 Fri 19:12]

This is because depending on the context (embedded in the spied app or
standalone), we want to load different classes which may or may not be
available at this time.

** DONE test the method capture with a BigProject [50%]

mvn -Dtest=MyITest test
*** DONE find how to pass javaagent args to the itest
CLOSED: [2012-09-11 Tue 11:40]

The javaagent is not triggered as the fork mode is set to never.
It means that the tests are ran in the same jvm as maven, which as no javagent

It's working but without maven

**** DONE add some println when starting the agent to understand what's going on
CLOSED: [2012-09-09 Sun 16:14]

**** FAIL can I use surefire and the agent? => no
CLOSED: [2012-09-09 Sun 16:51]

it's hell: in forking mode, surefire generate a jar, and then launch the
tests with java -jar, meaning -cp (and -javaagent?) are ignored
completly

**** FAIL try to run in "no fork mode", by using MAVEN_OPTS [100%]
CLOSED: [2012-09-09 Sun 19:41]

***** DONE first try to run the test in fork mode (no agent)
CLOSED: [2012-09-09 Sun 17:00]

it works!
so at least for this test, the build is not affected by fork=never!

***** FAIL try with the agent now
CLOSED: [2012-09-09 Sun 19:41]


**** DONE run the test for a BigProject with swanject, and without maven [%]
CLOSED: [2012-09-11 Tue 11:40]

*** TODO Run the Big Project work with the agent

*** TODO Collect the data from the Big Project
* TODO nice to have [0%]
** TODO check the license of aspectJ to know if we can embed it

it would allow to embed the aspectj libs, to avoid the user having to
install them
** TODO before/after/afterThrow => around

because we use before/after/afterThrow instead of around
we can read but not modify
it would be nice to be able to modify the args of a method, the return
value, the execption, ...

** TODO wait for the swank server to start (with a nice msg)

* TODO ideas [%]

** TODO allow to alter args / return values / exceptions (or even don't throw the exception)

It would be straightforward to change the signature of the Callback, and
the agent code to allow:
- Changing the parameters passed to the intercepted method: Just make
  =before= returns an array of params
- Changing the return value of the intercepted method: just make =after=
  returns a (possibly) modified return value
- Changing the exception, or even changing it to no exception and return
  value instead: just change =afterThrow= to returns an (possibly
  modified) exception (and maybe an additionnal flag to indicate that we
  want to change the exception by a normal return value)
